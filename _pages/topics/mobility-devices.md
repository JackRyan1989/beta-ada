   Some people with disabilities use mobility devices to get around. A person with a disability has the right to choose the mobility device best suited to their needs.

   In the ADA, these mobility devices fall into two main categories:
   1. Wheelchairs (manual or power-driven) and manual devices
   2. Other power-driven mobility devices (OPDMDs)
