  Some people with disabilities use mobility devices to get around. A person with a disability has the right to choose the mobility device best suited to their needs.

  In the ADA, these mobility devices fall into two main categories:
  1. Wheelchairs (manual or power-driven) and manual devices
  2. Other power-driven mobility devices (OPDMDs)
---

## Basic Requirements

**State/local governments and businesses** must allow a person with a disability who uses a _wheelchair or other manually powered mobility aid_ into all areas where members of the public are allowed to go.

**A person with a disability** who uses an OPDMD must be allowed to enter businesses and government facilities unless it can be shown that a particular type of device cannot be safely used.

## Wheelchairs and Manually Powered Devices

Wheelchairs are manually operated or power-driven devices used mostly by people have a disability that impacts their ability to get around.

Manually powered mobility aids include:

- Walkers
- Canes
- Crutches
- Braces
- Wheelchairs

## Other Power-Driven Mobility Devices

An “other power-driven mobility device” (OPDMD) is any mobility device:

1. Not typically designed for people who have disabilities

2. Powered by batteries, fuel, or other engines
   These include:

- Golf carts
- Electronic personal assistance mobility devices (EPAMDs) such as Segways®
- Other devices designed to operate in areas without defined public routes, such as all-terrain vehicles (ATVs)

### Factors to Consider

Businesses and government offices must consider the following factors when deciding whether an OPDMD can be used:

- Type, size, weight, dimensions and speed of the device
- Pedestrian traffic in the facility
- Design and operational characteristics of the facility
  - Indoor or outdoor facility
  - Square footage
  - Furniture placement and density
  - OPDMD storage availability
- Legitimate safety requirements for operating the OPDMD
- Risk of serious harm to environmental, natural, or cultural resources
- Conflicts with federal land management requirements

After considering these factors, an agency or business might establish a policy that:

- Requires users to operate devices at the speed of pedestrian traffic
- Identifies locations where devices cannot go
- Provides instructions for going through security screening (if necessary)
- Indicates if storage is available for the device

## Asking Someone About Their Mobility Device

If a person with a disability enters a business or government facility using an OPDMD:

{% list check_circle %}
{% list_item %}
You may ask that they provide “credible assurance” that the device is used because of a disability.

You must accept any of these types of credible assurance:

- A valid, state-issued disability parking placard
- Other state-issued proof of disability
- A statement from the person that the OPDMD is used because of a disability, unless the person is observed doing something that contradicts this statement
  {% endlist_item %}
  {% list_item cancel %}
  You may not ask about the nature or extent of someone’s disability. This is also true if someone is using a wheelchair or other manual mobility aid.
  {% endlist_item %}
  {% endlist %}
